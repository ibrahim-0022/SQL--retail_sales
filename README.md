# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
**Level**: Beginner  
**Database**: `Retails_Sales_DB`

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries.

## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `Retails_Sales_DB`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sales date, sales time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sales amount.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE Retail_Sales_DB;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sales_date DATE,
    sales_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,
    gender VARCHAR(15),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(15),
    quantiy INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sales FLOAT
);
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Total_Sales" FROM retail_sales
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS "Customers"FROM retail_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category AS "Total Category" FROM retail_sales;

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE transactions_id IS NULL
    OR sales_date IS NULL 
    OR sales_time IS NULL 
    OR gender IS NULL 
    OR category IS NULL
    OR quantiy IS NULL 
    OR cogs IS NULL 
    OR total_sales IS NULL;

ALTER TABLE retail_sales
RENAME COLUMN quantiy TO quantity;

DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE transactions_id IS NULL
    OR sales_date IS NULL 
    OR sales_time IS NULL 
    OR gender IS NULL 
    OR category IS NULL
    OR quantity IS NULL 
    OR cogs IS NULL 
    OR total_sales IS NULL;
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

1. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05**:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```

2. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than equal to 4 in the month of Nov-2022**:
```sql
SELECT 
	*
FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
	category = 'Clothing'
	AND 
	sales_date BETWEEN '2022-11-01' AND '2022-11-30'
	AND
	quantity >= 4;
```

3. **Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales(total_sales) for each category.**:
```sql
SELECT 
	category, 
	SUM(total_sales) AS "Net_sales",
	COUNT(*) AS "Total_orders_for_each_category"
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

4. **Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.**:
```sql
SELECT 
	ROUND(AVG(age), 2) AS "Average_age"
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty';
```

5. **Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.**:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sales > 1000;
```

6. **Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions(transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.**:
```sql
SELECT 
	category,
	gender, 
	COUNT(transactions_id) AS "Total_Transactions"
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category, gender
ORDER BY 1;
```

7. **Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year**:
```sql
SELECT 
	Year,
	Month,
	Average_Sales
FROM
(
SELECT 
		EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sales_date) AS Year,
		EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sales_date) AS Month,
		AVG(total_sales) AS Average_Sales,
		RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sales_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sales) DESC) as Rank
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1, 2
) AS T1
WHERE Rank = 1;
```

8. **Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales **:
```sql
SELECT 
	customer_id, 
	SUM(total_sales) AS Highest_total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

9. **Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.**:
```sql
SELECT 
	category, 
	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers 
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

10. **Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)**:
```sql
WITH hourly_sales AS
(
SELECT *,
	CASE 
		WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sales_time) < 12 THEN 'MORNING'
		WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sales_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'AFTERNOON'
		ELSE 'EVENING'
	END AS shift
FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT 
	shift,
	COUNT(*) AS Total_orders
FROM hourly_sales
GROUP BY shift;
```

## Findings

- **Customer Demographics**: The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different categories such as Clothing and Beauty.
- **High-Value Transactions**: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases.
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons.
- **Customer Insights**: The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories.

## Reports

- **Sales Summary**: A detailed report summarizing total sales, customer demographics, and category performance.
- **Trend Analysis**: Insights into sales trends across different months and shifts.
- **Customer Insights**: Reports on top customers and unique customer counts per category.
